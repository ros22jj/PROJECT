 Project: Interactive Resume Builder

  Description:
  
  The Interactive Resume Builder is a responsive web application that allows users to input their personal details (name, contact information, skills, education, and experience) and 
  generates a professional resume in real time. The user interface is designed with a clean and intuitive form on one side and a live resume preview on the other. The layout adapts 
  seamlessly to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent experience across devices.

  Features:
1.  Real-time Resume Preview:
   - As users fill out the form, their resume preview is updated dynamically without refreshing the page.

2. Dynamic Form Fields:
   - Users can add multiple rows for "Education" and "Experience" entries using JavaScript.

3. Responsive Design:
   - The layout uses media queries to ensure it looks good on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

4.  Interactive UI:
   - Smooth CSS transitions for form elements and resume preview updates provide a polished user experience.
   
5.  Form Reset:
   - A "Clear Form" button allows users to reset the form and the resume preview in one click.

6. Optional Skills Selection:
   - Users can select skills via checkboxes, which are reflected in the resume.

     
This project is a great way to practice building interactive web applications using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
